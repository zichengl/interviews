container and trading.

Given a shipping yard with infinite capacity for containers and has clients who would like to store their containers. 

Design a system which can manage the operations of the yard.
start with a client intending to add or remove containers, i.e. (containers, amount)
improve functionality by extending the system to buying and selling operations, maintain an order book where logs of each buy and sell order requests are logged
introduce bidding for each buy and sell request, based on the best offer, make the transaction.
Was asked to explain complexity of the solution as well as where I could have improved.


Design and code a container system.
The system needs to track the number of clients, how many containers they own and the account balance. Write down the required API's To track the clients, update the containers and also the account balance.
Extension to the above question, add a purchase log book. Track of the buy and sell of containers by the user.

Another extension to the problem is :
Write an API to check if if a user wants to sell a container that user gets the highest rate to sell.
To buy a container the user needs to check for the lowest price to buy.
